The Simon game is a web-based implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. The player initiates the game by pressing a key, and the computer generates a sequence of colored buttons. The player must then replicate this sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order. The game dynamically updates the display, plays corresponding sounds, and progresses through levels as the player successfully reproduces the patterns.
